# Graph Creation, Ordering, and Coloring With Detailed Asymptotic Run Time Analysis

#### This project was done for CS5350 - Algorithm Engineering
#### The detailed requirements for the project can be found in [Project requirements.pdf](Project_requirements.pdf)
#### The accompanying report I wrote can be found in [Project Report.pdf](Project%20Report.pdf)

## High Level Requirements Summary
* Be able to analyze the runtime complexity of large projects
* Give accurate asymptotic running time analysis for all graph generation, vertex ordering, and coloring functions
* Accuratly time execution of different parts of the code for analysis and optimization
* Ability to create different types of graphs of any size including:
  * cycles
  * complete graphs
  * graphs with uniform and skewed distributions
  * graphs with normal distributions
* Implement differnt algorithms for coloring graphs given an ordering
* Efficently order graphs based of different criteria
* Implement a custom data structre for Smallest Last Vertex ordering to guarntee a Î¸(V + E) runtime

I earned a 100 for the project and accompanying report
